Note that 'stop', 'pause', 'play', 'resume' events are controller events
which shall not be confused with player methods. 
Note that powering off a member does *not* generate a 'stop' event, only
clearing the playlist does

When a virtual starts, all members are assembled. If empty, previoussyncgroup 
is set to current syncgroup if any, otherwise it is set to -1. It's because
when a player is member of more than one virtual that were both playing 
(first 1 then 2), we don't want it to re-join the 1st virtual when the 2nd
stops, it must rejoin the inital syncgroup, if any. It would be especially
bad if the 1st virtual has stopped because it would create a fantom group
To have such player re-join the 1st virtual, then play something on it!

When a virtual stops, all *still* synchronized members re-join their 
previoussyncgroup (in no-restart mode) unless itâ€™s -1. If that group is 
playing then re-joining players are powered off. It could be unpleasant to
have stopped a virtual and one of its member restarts playing because of 
that re-grouping. The previoussyncgroup property must be deleted.

When a virtual pauses, the process is the same. In fact, pause and stop
are very similiar, stop seems to only happens when the playlist is cleared
or finished

Nicely, when a member is powered off, no stop event is generated, but it's 
put out of the active member list (in 'allPlayers' but not in 'players')
and method 'syncedWith' returns 'allPlayers'

When a member stops (closing a playlist), it leaves the virtual but does
not stop it (this is only doable with replaced Slim::Player::Source and 
Slim::Player::Playlist, otherwise the events do not include the player 
which generated it, so only option for 'stop' is to treat it as master's 
event). It re-joins (in norestart mode) its savedsyncgroup (property is 
deleted) which cannot be another virtual as explained earlier. Still, if
such group is playing, it would be the same issue as when the virtual stops
so the player is powered off - although one can argue that the user explicitly
cleared the playlist, so such re-join effect could be expected

When a member pauses, the virtual pauses with it as it is assumed that if the
user just wanted to change something on this particular player, it would power
it off or change its playlist (see above). Then, one can assume that user might
want to press resume on a member and expects the virtual to resume. For this 
to be achieved, the virtual is not disassembled.
